Tasks To Complete

 0. Strace is your friend

0-strace_is_your_friend.pp contains a Puppet manifest that fixes a faulty server.

Info:

Using strace, find out why Apache is returning a 500 error. Once you find the issue, fix it and then automate it using Puppet (instead of using Bash as you were previously doing).

HINT:

strace can attach to a current running process.

You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one.
